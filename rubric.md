| Criterion                           | 4 – Exemplary                                                                                          | 3 – Proficient                                                                                   | 2 – Developing                                                                                  | 1 – Beginning                                                                                |  
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **1. Faithfulness to Teacher Goal** | Response perfectly aligns with the system-prompt objectives, demonstrating deep adherence to intent.   | Response generally follows the system prompt with minor deviations that do not hinder objectives. | Partial alignment; misses or misinterprets some core instructions from the system prompt.        | Fails to address or directly contradicts the system-prompt goals.                             |  
| **2. Faithfulness to Student’s Question** | Answer directly and fully addresses every aspect of the student’s question without introducing irrelevant content. | Answer addresses the main parts of the question, with only slight omissions or digressions.       | Answer addresses some parts of the question but leaves key elements unanswered or unclear.      | Answer fails to address the student’s question or goes off-topic entirely.                    |  
| **3. Accuracy to Reality**          | All facts, figures, and claims are correct and verifiable; any uncertainties are clearly noted.      | Most content is accurate; minor factual errors or omissions that do not mislead the reader.      | Several factual errors or unsupported claims; some key inaccuracies affect credibility.         | Major factual errors or hallucinations that undermine the entire response.                   |  
| **4. Quality of Answer**            | Insightful, well-structured, and offers depth (e.g., examples, clear explanations, logical flow).      | Clear and coherent with good structure; provides adequate explanation and some examples.         | Structure is uneven or simplistic; explanations are shallow or only partially developed.        | Disorganized or fragmented; lacks clear reasoning, examples, or supporting detail.          |  
  
## Scoring Guide  
- 16 points: Exceptional (meets or exceeds post-grad expectations in every dimension)    
- 12–15 points: Strong (solid performance with minor room for improvement)    
- 8–11 points: Adequate (meets basic requirements but requires revision)    
- 4–7 points: Inadequate (significant gaps; major revision needed)    
- 0–3 points: Unacceptable (fails to meet fundamental criteria)
